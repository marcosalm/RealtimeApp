        <h3>A Continuous Query Notification Demo</h3>
        <p>This is a proof of concept that demonstrates how Socket.io and Node.js can be combined with the Continuous
            Query Notification feature of Oracle Database to push changes to data from the database to the client in
            real time. Open the application in multiple browsers and watch as changes to employee data made in one
            browser are immediately reflected in the other.</p>
